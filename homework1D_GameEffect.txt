CMPM Homework1D: Discuss a visual effect

"Take a screenshot (or photo) of an interesting visual effect you noticed in a video game or
computational artwork. In a few paragraphs, describe the effect. What do you like about it?
How do you think it was created? Does the effect change depending on the camera view?
The lights? Is it an effect that updates the geometry itself, or change the color of the pixels,
or does it alter a texture?"

The visual effect I've chosen is the card pack opening animation from Hearthstone.  As the most
popular digital card game, hearthstone's developers at Blizzard knew that one of the best parts
of a trading cards is the satisfaction that comes from opening up a pack of cards you paid $6.99
for..  Without the physical sensation of opening up the plastic and pulling the cards out with
your hands, the designers knew they had to do something visually to make the experience of gaining
new cards as satisfying as in real life.

The second screen shot I took, the first I pulled from the internet since it shows off the effects
better.  There's also an animation that happens when the pack opens up and the 5 cards pop out
but it was too hard for me to capture that in the screen shot/find it online.

I think the glowing effects that are a different color depending on rarity of the card are the key.
The glowing effect harkens back to hologrpahic card backings in physical trading cards.  The way the
cards move and float when you hover your mouse over them and flip over dramatically when you click them
makes this effect so good for providing that satisfying experience of opening a card pack.

I think they used lighting to make the glowing effect realistic and shine on all the cards.
The explosion when the pack opens is a mystery to me.  It's a very advanced 3D effect and for the most
part I'm unsure of exactly what techniques were utilized.
